Project Title: Syriatel Customer Churn Analysis
Author: Mercy Chebet

 Project Overview
Used machine learning classification to predict customer churn.
Dataset: 3,333 records, 20 features.
Churners: 14.49%, Non-churners: 85.51%.
Evaluation metric: Recall.

 Business Understanding
Customer churn affects telecom revenue.
Retaining customers is cheaper than acquiring new ones.
Goal: Predict churn and understand key drivers.

 Research Objectives
Build an accurate model to predict churn.
Identify important features linked to churn.

 Data Understanding
Data types: Categorical & continuous.
No missing or duplicate records.
Converted area code to categorical.

 Target Variable Distribution
Churn = 14.49%, Non-churn = 85.51%.
Imbalanced dataset.

 Feature Distributions
Numeric features have varied scales.
Some are skewed; require scaling.

 Correlation Analysis
Strong correlations between duration and charge features.
Weak correlation between features and churn.

 Data Preparation
Dropped highly correlated variables.
Train-test split: 80/20.
Applied SMOTE to balance training data.

 Baseline Model: Logistic Regression
Applied scaling.
Performance:
High train recall, low test recall.
Overfitting observed.

 Decision Tree Model
Initial model had improved recall.
Still overfitted slightly.

 Feature Selection with RFECV
Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation.
Selected top 15 features out of 64.

 Hyperparameter Tuning
Tuned using GridSearchCV.
Best parameters:
Criterion: entropy
Max depth: 28
Min samples leaf: 2
Performance improved, reduced overfitting.

 Final Model Evaluation
Recall: 0.65
Precision: ~0.47
Accuracy: ~0.86

Customer service calls
Total international minutes

 Recommendations
Improve customer service monitoring.
Analyze and adjust call pricing.
Focus retention on high-duration users.

 Next Steps
Increase training data.
Try ensemble models (e.g., XGBoost).
Investigate external features like demographics.

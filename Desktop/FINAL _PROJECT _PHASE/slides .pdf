Slide 1: Title Slide
Project Title: Syriatel Customer Churn Analysis
Author: Mercy Chebet

Slide 2: Project Overview
Used machine learning classification to predict customer churn.
Dataset: 3,333 records, 20 features.
Churners: 14.49%, Non-churners: 85.51%.
Evaluation metric: Recall.

Slide 3: Business Understanding
Customer churn affects telecom revenue.
Retaining customers is cheaper than acquiring new ones.
Goal: Predict churn and understand key drivers.

Slide 4: Research Objectives
Build an accurate model to predict churn.
Identify important features linked to churn.

Slide 5: Data Understanding
Data types: Categorical & continuous.
No missing or duplicate records.
Converted area code to categorical.

Slide 6: Target Variable Distribution
Churn = 14.49%, Non-churn = 85.51%.
Imbalanced dataset.

Slide 7: Feature Distributions
Numeric features have varied scales.
Some are skewed; require scaling.

Slide 8: Correlation Analysis
Strong correlations between duration and charge features.
Weak correlation between features and churn.

Slide 9: Data Preparation
Dropped highly correlated variables.
Train-test split: 80/20.
Applied SMOTE to balance training data.

Slide 10: Baseline Model: Logistic Regression
Applied scaling.
Performance:
High train recall, low test recall.
Overfitting observed.

Slide 11: Decision Tree Model
Initial model had improved recall.
Still overfitted slightly.
Feature importance plot

Slide 12: Feature Selection with RFECV
Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation.
Selected top 15 features out of 64.

Slide 13: Hyperparameter Tuning
Tuned using GridSearchCV.
Best parameters:
Criterion: entropy
Max depth: 28
Min samples leaf: 2
Performance improved, reduced overfitting.

Slide 14: Final Model Evaluation
Recall: 0.65
Precision: ~0.47
Accuracy: ~0.86
Confusion matrix and metrics summary

Slide 15: ROC Curve
ROC AUC: 0.65
Model has moderate discriminative power.

Slide 16: Key Predictive Features
Total day minutes
Total evening minutes
Customer service calls
Total international minutes

Slide 17: Recommendations
Improve customer service monitoring.
Analyze and adjust call pricing.
Focus retention on high-duration users.

Slide 18: Next Steps
Increase training data.
Try ensemble models (e.g., XGBoost).
Investigate external features like demographics.
